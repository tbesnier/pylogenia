# Pylogenia
Python package for phylogenetic estimation based on morphology

The goal of this project is to gather and use tools from computational geometry to apply them to morphological data.

## Features

### Comparing morphologies

In /examples, just run _python3 compute_distances.py_ to get a .csv file containing a pair-wise distance matrix of meshes in data/preprocessed

### Register meshes (based on PyKeOps)

In /examples, run plot_registration_mesh.py with target and source meshes as arguments to get an .html file of an approximation of the geodesic path from the source to the target.
