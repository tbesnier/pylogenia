# Pylogenia
Python package for phylogenetic estimation based on morphology

The goal of this project is to gather and use tools from computational geometry to apply them to morphological data.

## Phylogenetics and morphology

## Geometric data

### Point clouds

### Mesh processing
When it comes to represent shapes in a natural and efficient way, meshes are the way to go.

## Comparing shapes/morphology
### LDDMM Matching framework

### Distances between meshes
A python file named "compute_distances" in /examples takes as input a directory containing .ply file and a string specifying the type of distance (Varifold, hausdorff,...) and output a .csv file with a pair-wise distance matrix between all meshes in the directory.

## Evolution is random but controlled

## Statistics in the shape space
