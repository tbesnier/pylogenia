# Pylogenia
Python package for phylogenetic estimation based on morphology

The goal of this project is to gather and use tools from computational geometry to apply them to morphological data.

## Phylogenetics and morphology

## Geometric data

### Point clouds

### Mesh processing
When it comes to represent shapes in a natural and efficient way, meshes are the way to go.

### Implicit representation

## Evolution is random but controlled

## Matching shapes

## Statistics in the shape space
